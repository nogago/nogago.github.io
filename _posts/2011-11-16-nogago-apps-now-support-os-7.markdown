We have silently released new versions of all our apps for BlackBerry on nogago.com and BlackBerry AppWorld that provide the long awaited OS 7 support for new devices.

While nothing really has changed on at the surface of Outdoor and Head-Up Display, we have worked hard to improve the usability of nogago Guide on Touch devices and improved many smaller bugs here and there.

As always, uptodates to existing customers are free of charge as long as they keep on using the same device. Using the apps on another device will require to purchase a new serial key. Your offline maps will work on any device and can be shared with friends and family.

Please log in to nogago.com to retrieve your maps and serial keys, if you need to find them back.

Enjoy your nogago apps on BlackBerry OS 7 devices !
