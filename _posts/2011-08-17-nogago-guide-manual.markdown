## **Downloading maps ****(won't work with the iPhone)**


**Of course you get maps on the fly while using nogago Guide online. Yet, offline maps are faster, more reliable, cheaper if you travel abroad and you get huge areas in a size of one degree latitude and longitude!**

**The following step-by-step instructions show how to generate maps on the nogago portal and install them on your device. Steps 1 to 4 only have to be run through when you use the nogago Web Downloader for the first time.**

1. When you are logged in to the [nogago portal](https://www.nogago.com/userLogin/auth), then go to maps and search for your desired location or city.

2. After clicking the Download button, you will be redirected to the Map-download page. By clicking the "Map" button, you go to step 3.

3. As the following screen shows, the nogago Web Downloader will start (open as a java programm) or be downloaded automatically. To be able to execute this java application please ensure java se is installed.

![](http://blog.nogago.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/4.png)4. You will be asked where to save your maps locally and where on your Blackberry device. You can select the according folders manually or by autodetermining the directory for your smartphone device. On your Devices SD-Card please save them in the root subfolder /maps. (nogago Outdoor does create the folder /maps/... and /tracks/ on first launch)

After selecting the appropriate folders where to save your maps, save your preferences.

## Using nogago Guide


The basic function of the nogago Guide main menu is _**Go to your position**._ This item is selectable if your current position is identified by GPS. If it’s greyed out your device is not able to locate your position by GPS or cell info. Please make sure that GPS is activated and gets connected to a GPS satellite. Start a search for your points of interest (POIs) nearby in a map-view.

![Go to your position](http://blog.nogago.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Guide-Android-main-menu.png)

![Guide-Android-POI-Places-List-view](http://blog.nogago.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Guide-Android-POI-Places-List-view.png)























Start a search for your points of interest (POIs) nearby in a map-view.







If there are POIs nearby, star icons indicate locations of sights and are selectable by click to show related content like photos or Wikipedia articles. Within the rich content you can create a new tour guide or add or remove your POIs to or from an existing tour guide.
Maps are navigated by touch gestures. In online mode 18 zoom levels are available. In offline mode zoom levels are limited between levels 10 and 15.
If you move the center of a map to another position new sights are sought automatically. Results are suggested within the current map and the results-list for list view is updated as well.
If you like to** **_**Find a city with name **_or to_** Find a sight with name**_ use the specific search dialogues. Any queries are allowed to find cities or regions or specific sights. For example: Search "Paris" or "Louvre". Once you found a region of interest you can conduct further searches (for sights and places) within.

![Guide-Android-Search-1](http://blog.nogago.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Guide-Android-Search-1.png)

You will certainly look for special places like hotels or hostels, restaurants, ATMs or public transportation either on your actual location or your desired destination. nogago Guide can show you more than 50 different kinds of places (a list of places that can be found with nogago Guide you find [here](http://blog.nogago.de/nogago-guide-places/) or in the sreenshot above). In map view select the context menu for places, you then will be asked to type in a query (best you give just the initials) or chose from list. You can switch between map and list view. To adjust density of desired places in map view operate your zoom level. This being so in low zoom levels nogago Guide displays more places than in high zoom levels.
