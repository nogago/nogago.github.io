Dear Playbook users,
unfortunately BlackBerry is no longer supporting your tablet. Therefore the security certificates that are regularly renewed as a best practice by nogago are no longer accepted by the device.

To download maps please use the workaround solution and visit [https://download.nogago.com/ ](https://download.nogago.com/)and download the offline maps using your PC or Mac using your regular nogago.com username. 

In a second step please transfer the downloaded files (file ending .obf) into the nogago storage directory that is available under `/misc/android/nogago` in device memory of the Playbook. Map files loaded this way will not display in the list of downloaded maps, but will work if you zoom into a location that is covered by the map.

As an optional step, you can rename the maps to have them also appear in the downloaded maps list. 




<blockquote>For instance I just downloaded the Miami area map (63240288.obf) and then renamed it to (Miami;e.63240288.obf) and now it appears in my list of Maps as â€œMiami (East)"</blockquote>



(Our thanks go to John Radford for pointing this out).
