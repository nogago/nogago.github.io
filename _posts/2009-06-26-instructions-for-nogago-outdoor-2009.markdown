There are two main use cases for nogago.



	
  1. Track and measure where you are going.

	
  2. Navigate along a prerecorded track.


**Track and measure where you are going**

After opening nogago the instrument view is displayed.

[![instrument display](http://78.46.135.14/en/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/instrument.png)](http://78.46.135.14/en/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/instrument.png)

You need to **connect to the GPS** (press "1") to detect a signal. This usually takes about one minute or so, after that the red marker starts to move around and shows you where North is. Additionally in the topline of the display you see your current coordinates. The marker for "North" is unreliable until you start moving.

You can create a **track log** (press "0") of your movements and share this track with your friends and family when you are back. Press "3" to **reset the odometer**, whenever you want to start over with measuring your time and distance. This does not affect your track log but resets display, so when back home you can analyze how far, fast and long you went for what was recorded.

You can see your traces in the **map mode pressing "9"** (always facing north) and return to the instrument view by pressing "9" again.

In map mode your current position is displayed as a red dot. Your current track log is displayed as a red line and shows you where you went.

When you are back home, you can view your track on the map, and do all kinds of fun things (example fly along your track in Google Earth. Share your favorite tracks with the world, such as this fellow shared his round trip on Cook island (map provided by OpenCycleMap):

**Navigate along a pre-recorded track.**

You can download tracks from Internet communities such as gpsies and store these tracks on your mobile. You can even do this over the air (access [m.gpsies.com](m.gpsies.com) from your BlackBerry® browser).  You can **load the track** by pressing "2". Tracks must be in GPX format. As nogago track logs are also in GPX formats, you can also follow one of your previous track logs.

nogago will then enter the navigation mode. Two additional markers appear in the instrument view to give you directions to your next waypoint. The black bar shows you the direction for the next waypoint.

[![instrument display](http://78.46.135.14/en/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/instrument.png)](http://78.46.135.14/en/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/instrument.png)

In the example you need to go right. The waypoint after next (depicted in grey) also is found in that direction.



	
  * If you have to go left the blackbar is on the left side of the compass.

	
  * If you have to go on straight it is on the top of the compass.

	
  * If you have to go right, the black bar is on the right side of the compass.

	
  * If you have to go back, the black bar is on the bottom side of the compass.


The bar on the right hand side shows you the distance to the next waypoint and - as you get closer - this bar will shrink.
Below the bar you see the estimated distance to your next waypoint.

Just in case, you loose your track, press "5" to **find the closest waypoint** and get directions there. Pressing "4" and "6" allows you to select the **previous and next waypoint** respectively. By pressing "7" you can **reverse your direction** and turn around and go back along the track.

Depending where you are the GPS signal has a certain precision (between 10 and 100m). We accomodate for this and recognize that you have arrived at a certain waypoint if you came close enough to the waypoint. This is triggered by distance. Press **"8" to alter the trigger distance** between 25m, 50m, 75m and 100m. Once you arrive at a a waypoint nogago will beep.
