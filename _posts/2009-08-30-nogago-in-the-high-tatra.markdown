We took nogago to the smallest of alpine mountain range in Europe - the high Tatra. The High Tatra (Slovak: Vysok√© Tatry, Polish: Tatry Wysokie) are a mountain range on the borders between Slovakia and Poland just some 50 km south of Krakow.

Unfortunately I lost my BlackBerry charger in a hotel in Zakopane, such that we only had partial coverage of our hike. But the BlackBerry (mobile network mostly switched off) lasted full 2 days on a single full charge. Enough to give full coverage of two days of our hike.Considering that the Garmin Oregon 550 only functions for 12 hours (in our last test on the west weg), this is twice the battery performance - not bad for a free app!

Looking at the recorded GPX files, the vertical and horizontal precision was quite good in high altitude. However, our first version still has a problem when stopping (it doesn't recognize that one has stopped) therby artificially prolonging the tracks by recording a false distance arising the GPS signal variation.

Nevertheless we had some great days on beautiful mountains.

**Day 1 (23 km):**

_First etappe - Early morning to first breakfast_




_Second etappe - First breakfast to second breakfast_



_Third etappe - Second breakfast to lunch_


A very difficult etappe with several chains and steep descents near a narrow and steep tracks. nogago was locked away in my shirt pocket to prevent the BlackBerry being lost. In this situation the GPS signal quality deteroriated massively (but was never lost). Hence, i manually corrected the recorded track using the GPSies editor and track smoothing functionality.




_Fourth etappe - Lunch to coffee break_




_Fifth etappe - Coffee break to the days destination: Schranisko przy Morskim Oko_



**Day 2 (30 km):**

A rather flat and boring morning etappe to get from Poland to Slovakia on a not so difficult and steep trail without chains. After stopping at Scrhoniske w Dolinie Rodfoki for a early breakfast we went on to Lysa Polana (border between Slovakia and Poland). After getting lost seeking a biking trail that was charted on the map but not in existence, we finally arrived in the first village on the Slovakian side: Tatranska Javorina. From here a nice and gentle trail following the Javorinka river started to descent back into the Tatra mountains, which we followed. We stopped at a small spring to have a second breakfast.



_Second etappe - Second breakfast to lunch_

After breakfast we went on through the beautiful Javorinka valley and started to ascend to Kopske sedlo, at 1778 m the highest point of this days trip.



And from there it was a nice way down to Chata pri Zelenom plese where we stayed over night.



**Day 3 and 4 (ca. 15 km)**
Unfortunately - due to lost charger - this is a hand-made GPX file tracing our track. We stopped at Zamkovskeho chata early on the third day due to heavy rain in the afternoon. On day four we eventually descended from Zamkovskeho chata to Stary Smokovec.
