You can [download Outdoor GPS for BlackBerry on our website](http://www.nogago.com/apps/download/2?platform=BlackBerry). 
nogago Outdoor and Guide are generally free, but the free versions are limited, for example Outdoor GPS cannot navigate along tracks and does not provide routing.
If you would like to use those features, you will need to [purchase a serial key](http://www.nogago.com/apps/download/2?platform=BlackBerry). After purchasing you will receive an email that mentions the serial key for safe keeping. Your serial key can also be retrieved from your account at any later time.

**For users that download Outdoor GPS from BlackBerry Appworld the following instructions DO NOT APPLY as they automatically unlock the navigation features when buying after trying the app.**

The following instructions show how to enter the serial key in nogago Outdoor after purchasing it from our website.
