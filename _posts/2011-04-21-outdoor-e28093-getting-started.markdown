### **nogago Outdoor – Getting started**




nogago Outdoor transforms your phone into a fully-fledged outdoor navigation device. Track and measure time, distance and speed of your activities; view maps of the area anytime and offline; navigate along tracks and planed routes with routing optimized for walking and biking. Nogago outdoor is made for people not for cars! nogago Outdoor requires a BlackBerry with GPS (either internal or attached via Bluetooth) and a SD-Card inserted into the device to store maps and tracks.




The Application starts with a Main-Screen offering several Sub-Screens to call. Depending on the availability and reception of the GPS position, only a limited range of functions will be selectable. Without a position fix, you can start the “Map”, “Flashlight” and “Load Track”.




You can browse the available screens by pressing “space” key or by selecting and click on the wished section icon on the Main-Screen. All options and functions are available in the System-Menu by pressing the BlackBerry-Key. The specific functions can also be called by key-shortcuts for power-users. Those shortcuts are assigned by the letter after the function in the System-Menu. Once your device successfully received a GPS-Coordinate fix and remains in receiving coverage, the light changes from red into green mode. Thereafter the functions to display your current position and record tracks along with many other features are available.











### **How to ensure you GPS is working:**


Autonomous GPS mode and troubleshooting hints:
1.) Make sure your GPS is on and active by

a1) OS5 - Open the Options -> Advanced Options -> GPS / Location Service
a2) OS6 - Open the Options -> Device -> Location Settings
- if your Device has a built in GPS Sensor you wish to use:
b1) Set GPS Data Source to “Device GPS”
- if you wish to use an external GPS Sensor bundled over a Bluetooth connection
b2) Set GPS Data Source e.g. to “GPS Bluetooth”

c) Set GPS Services to “Location On”

d) Set Location Aiding to “Enabled” (if you have a data connection and you are in a good reception area to speed up GPS fix)

2.) Preferably, outdoors get a clear view of the sky! Sometimes near a window is good enough for proper and fast GPS signal reception.

3.) With the Autonomous GPS method the first complete fix may take as long as five minutes. This is a normal part of the process. With a clear view of the sky, a partial fix should be available within minutes. A complete fix depends on the number of satellites visible, and the download time of GPS satellite location information (ephemeris).

**Note:** enabling 1. d above will decrease the ephemeris download time in a good wireless reception area. In a bad wireless signal area, you may want to temporarily disable location aiding. If the ephemeris data has already been downloaded since, your last reboot or major location change a complete fix should follow quickly. None of these things is under the control of nogago Outdoor Application, it is just the way Autonomous GPS works.

This can be done at OS5: Options -> Memory -> Compression -> Disabled and for OS6: Options -> Device -> Storage -> enable Compression -> Off.To enable access to your Phone’s SD-Card and internal Memory when connected via USB to your Desktop PC to e.g. transfer offline maps or tracks to your Phone please do also enable the Option “Media Card Support” and set “Mass Storage Mode Support” -> On To further be prompted to establish a shared drive on your Desktop PC in connecting the root auf your Device’s SD-Card as own drive-letter please do activate the option “Auto Enable Mass Storage Mode When Connected” to Yes or Prompt. Once the offline map or tracks have been transferred to you Device’s SD-Card, disconnect your Device from your Desktop PC to be able start the nogago Outdoor.
