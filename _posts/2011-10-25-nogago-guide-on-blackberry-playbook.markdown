We are happy to announce that we have successfully deployed nogago Guide, the ultimate travel guide to planet earth, on the BlackBerry Playbook using the upcoming PlayBook 2.0.0 OS and the then available Android player.

 [Let us know, if you want to enjoy the app on your PlayBook for free before it becomes available in BlackBerry App World.](mailto://rv@nogago.com/)

The only feature that we could not validate is the automatic language adjustment of the application menus (which are also available in German). However, you can at least read sight descriptions in your favorite language by changing the application settings manually. Enjoy sight descriptions in German, English, French, Dutch, Russian and Spanish.

nogago also connects with the built-in Playbook GPS receiver (you just have to be a little patient) and then provides you with (pedestrian) routing to sights and places when you are roaming around our nice little planet. Downloading sight descriptions works well and gives you blazing fast access to sight descriptions and images when outside network connectivity. 

**
... and preparing a trip watching sight images and reading sight descriptions is a real joy with the large Playbook display ! So... don't forget to pack your Playbook for your next business trip or vacation !**

PS: The option menu is displayed by striking down from the top of the display (this is the substitute for the Android menu button).

PPS: You can go back to the last screen by stricking from bottom to left corner (this is the substitute for the Android back button).

PPS: Offline Maps cannot be used yet on Playbook, pending some technical clarifications from RIM dev support. But we are working on that.
