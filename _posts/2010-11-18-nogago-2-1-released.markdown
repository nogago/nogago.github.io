nogago 2.1 released

We have quietly released a new version of nogago Outdoor in the last two days:



	
  * nogago has now stable pedestrian routing
for all of planet earth. Focus any point on the map using the crosshairs and press "R" or activate "Find route..." in the menu
to trigger routing for going by foot, bike or car.

	
  * Further, we have implemented the most asked for feature by our beta testers: Showing the direction of walking. A small blue dot moving around the crosshair shows your direction of movement.

	
  * Nogago Outdoor can now also check
for updates by itself ensuring that you use always use the latest version of the app.


Further we have fixed many important bugs:

	
  * Search for points of interest nearby now works on the western hemisphere

	
  * Time is displayed correclty for all time zones

	
  * Various zooming and map switching problems

	
  * Automatic calculation of route to point of interest / found address

	
  * Many other nasty little bugs


nogago is now also available on the [BlackBerry app world](https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/13904).
