**Point of interest:**

With offline maps installed you are able to conduct offline searches for special points of interest within the covered area of each offline map. Wherever you are, you are able to initiate ad hoc searches for points of interests like restaurants, bars, cafes, nightclubs, theatres, cabarets, places for shopping and many more. The search is started by the the key-shortcut (**F**) or via the system-menu-item "Find Nearby..." and then provides a list of available types of point of interes in your currents displayed area of the map.
By moving with the map to another area you are able to conduct searches in other locations than your current position. The map-center is always the base for you search queries. You can chose from up to 268 different types of facilities, places and sights to search.

The result of your search query is then populated as list and sorted by distance to your current possition (if position information is available). By the selecting the desired list entry you are pointed to its location and can further calculate a route to this item.
