The application nogago Outdoor is able to route you to a destination which you can select by moving the center of your map screen to your final destination other than your current position. The routing functionality will only be available when your have a stable GPS reception and thereby a position fix. To start the routing you can use the key-shortcut "**R**" or by calling the corespondent system-menu-entry "**Find Route**...". Nogago Outdoor askes you then wether your routing should be by car / bycicle or by foot and displays the best way to reach your destination from current GPS position. If you conducted a "**Find nearby**" - **"F"** search for one of the 268 different type of Point of Interest you can initiate a routing to this Point of Interest by executing "**Find Route...**"** -** "**R**" functions again.
