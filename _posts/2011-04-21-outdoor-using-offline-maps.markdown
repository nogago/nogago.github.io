**Using offline Maps:**

Purchased offline maps do cover about 28.000 square miles or even more and support the zoomlevels 0-6 and 10-15 until main street level. The offline maps are loaded from your SD-Card's folder "Maps". Thus, all purchased maps are saved within this folder by using the Java-Map-Downloader on your Desktop PC executed from www.nogago.com. The size of each map varies from few megabytes up to 200 megabytes per area and map on you SD-Card. This depends on the OSM sources detail level and information richness for the rendered area ([sample of map quality](http://blog.nogago.de/whats-new-with-our-maps/)). The application performance to load the offline maps depends on the number of maps stored on you SD-Card. For older devices, we do recommend a maximum of five maps on your SD-Card. With the [Java-Map-Downloader Tool](http://blog.nogago.de/nogago-outdoor-2010-user-manual/) you can easily install and uninstall maps to/from your Blackberry. A copy of the maps is always kept on your Desktop PC or your may download the maps again from your account at [www.nogago.com](http://www.nogago.com).

To load and view the offline maps switch into offline mode with key-shortcut "**Z**" or "**Y**" and browse to the area you purchased the map for. If you are out of range of your purchase and there are no data for the selected area available on your SD-Card grey map-tiles will be display.

**Navigation within the maps:**
