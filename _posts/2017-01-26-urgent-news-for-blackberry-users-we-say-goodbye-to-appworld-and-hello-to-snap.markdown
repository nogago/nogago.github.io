Dear (fellow) BlackBerry enthusiasts.

we stopped distributing nogago apps through BlackBerry AppWorld.

BlackBerry 10 users can continue to download our apps via the Google Play client [Snap](http://redlightoflove.com/snap/) free of charge. For owners of Android-based BlackBerry devices, our apps continue to be available from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nogago.android.maps) ([nogago Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nogago.android.maps), [nogago Tracks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nogago.bb10.tracks)) **free of charge**.

We have just published an update to the nogago Maps app on Google Play that adjusts font size for high device resolutions and makes downloading of maps directly from the app again possible. **A nogago.com user account is no longer required to download maps.** Users of older versions can install maps by [downloading them with a browser](http://download.nogago.com/) and copying the map files into the nogago folder on your smartphone or tablet.

Best regards,

the nogago team
