**Equipment**

Your BlackBerry® loaded with nogago has just one short coming when compared to a dedicated outdoor navigation device: it is not weatherproof and cannot be mounted on a bike. Don't worry, there are things to help you out:



	
  * [Waterproof  Case](http://www.pearl.de/a-PE3788-1121.shtml) (€ 10)

	
  * [Simple bike holder](http://www.pearl.de/a-PX2065-4044.shtml) (€ 15) not to be used for mountain biking or in the rain.


So,save yourself € 200 and the hassle of keeping yet another gadget charged. Save the environment another piece of toxic electronic trash (as you will certainly dispose your outdoor GPS in a couple of years, once GALILEO will give you 1m precision).**Find tracks**
