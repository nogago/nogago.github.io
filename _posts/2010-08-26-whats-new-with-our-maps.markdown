We source our maps from OpenStreetMap, the Wikipedia of maps, where more than 200.000 people collaborate on creating the best maps for planet earth.  [You can help and improve the map of your home community and other areas of interest](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide), just survey your neighborhood with nogago and then turn tracks into streets and waypoints into POIs using [JOSM](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/download/josm.jnlp).

nogago data is licensed under the same license terms ([CC-BY-SA 2.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/)) as Wikipedia and OSM. This means that you can share your maps freely with friends, family and colleagues. You need to mention nogago, OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia as the source of the data, if you want to distribute it to wider audiences or commercially.
