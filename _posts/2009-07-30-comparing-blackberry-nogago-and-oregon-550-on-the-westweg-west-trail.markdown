We are busy with preparing for the first long distance test of nogago. We will follow one of the most famous trails in Germany: The Westweg. The Westweg is the oldest of the German long distance trails and runs across the slopes of the Black Forest (where nogago was conceived), just some kilometers behind my house all way down to Basel, Switzerland. I will hike about 260 km in eight days.

We want to compare OUTDOOR navigation on BlackBerry with the newest GARMIN outdoor device: the OREGON 550 and learn about the short comings and benefits. Luckily, we have received the OREGON 550 just today and can already report on our first impressions from walking to lunch, back to the office and playing with the OREGON 550.

**Comparison #1: Weight
**
We have weighted the two contestants. BlackBerry wins with 150g for our BlackBerry Bold 9000 (device) / 260g ( Bold incl. charger) against the 210g of the OREGON 550 (300g with charger). While the weight differences are minimal, hikers usually care much for lighter luggage...

**Comparison #2: Beauty of the device**
A short survey among my colleagues cleary makes the BlackBerry a winner. The Garmin comes in an ugly ocker green and looks like a device made for war not for the pleasures for hiking.

**Comparison #3: Quality of the screen**
Sorry, but again BlackBerry wins. We were almost shocked when starting the OREGON for the first time. On the web (thanks to photoshop?) the screens look shiny and very readable. Out of the box all you get is a low contrast screen where white is light grey and black is dark grey and colors are pale. We have played with the settings of the device immediately. But to our shock you cannot change the brightness of the screen with the screen settings. So we thought we have to accept the circumstances. Only by chance, about 3 hours later, one of the colleagues pressed the power button of the OREGON by accident and "discovered" that this is the secret button to change screen brightness. Thank god ! We put it all the way up. But compared to the BlackBerry Bold screen it is still pale. We will make some pictures in sun light while going on.

**Comparison #4: Price
**The OREGON 550 is a whopping 449 € (Street price) and about 100 € more expensive than the Bold, which we bought without contract bindings/subsidies for 349 € early this year. This is without maps, which will cost another 179 € (street price) to obtain topographical maps for Germany. The cost of the map was even too high for us, so we bought "Deutschland Topo V3" used on ebay for about 60€. Unfortunately the map did not arrive yet.

**Comparison #5: barometric altitude and electronic compass.
**GARMIN wins but the features are very unconvincing. The out of the box precision of these two features are inacceptable (and nowhere in the short manual are instructions what has to be done). The compass moved about 45° when I actually turned 180°. The altitude here in the Karlsruhe office determined by GPS is about 120 m. This seems about right, Wikipedia states 115m (377 ft) for the city center. When I first looked at the barometric altimeter it returned 40ms. 80 m off on a perfect summer day with 25°C, no humidity, no clouds. Testing the setting features of the GARMIN OREGON 550, we discovered that there are means to calibrate compass and calibrate the altimeter (where we used the GPS signal calculated height, which is also available in the BlackBerry). Calibrating the compass was not fully satisfactory. Turning the device precisely 180° from west to east using a ruler actually led to a change of 165°, so about 15° off... Actually, also here, while moving the GPS calculated compass in nogago had the same precision. So while there are many features that are technically unavailable in the BlackBerry and are simulated by nogago, we actually dont see much of a benefit that would justify to pay for these features by buying an uppermost class OREGON model.

**Comparison #6: Satellite Fix.
**BlackBerry wins thanks got A-GPS. We had a satellite GPS fix about 10 minutes (!) earlier than with the out-of-the-box OREGON 550, which does not use A-GPS as it does not have cellular network access. This might be seen as an unfair comparison, because the OREGON will improve if one keeps on staying in the same region, but as a frequent traveller like myself, this was exactly the case why I could not use my FORERUNNER device on business trips. It just took too long to wait for a satellite signal when you popped up in another city and wanted to go running and record your tracks.

So, today the BlackBerry wins !

Tomorrow I will write about preparing the BlackBerry and the OREGON for its next voyage !
