Downloaded tracks from the portal www.nogago.com or other sources are to be found in file://SD-Card/Tracks/Downloaded/.. in addition, those can be selected and loaded. nogago Outdoor understands standard GPX 1.1 files with tracks and track-segments to work with. Once the file has been imported and loaded the track can be displayed and used for navigation in the MapScreen. To exchange or load tracks onto your device you will have to connect it via USB to your Desktop PC and activate "Mass Storage Mode". To do this enable the Option "**Media Card Support**" and set "**Mass Storage Mode Support**" -> **On**. To further be prompted to establish a shared drive on your Desktop PC in connecting the root auf your device's SD-Card as own drive-letter please do activate the option "Auto Enable Mass Storage Mode When Connected" to **Yes **or **Prompt**. Once the tracks have been transferred to you device's SD-Card, disconnect your device from your Desktop PC to be able start the nogago Outdoor and access the SD-Card's content.
