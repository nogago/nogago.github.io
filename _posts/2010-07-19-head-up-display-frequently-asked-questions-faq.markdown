- GPS Data Source: "Device GPS" - to use the internal GPS Chip of you RIM Device
- Location Service: "Location ON" - to activate GPS Location Service Feature

Optional and not necessary:
If network coverage is given, the time to get a GPS position fix can be shortened by activation of the following features:
Please be aware, that through these optional functions a GPRS data transfer might occur and charges may apply.
- Location Data: "Enabled" - Additional Data to generate a GPS Location Fix is collected through the Mobile Network and Accuracy is sharpened.
- Location Aiding "Enabled" - Additional Data to generate a GPS Location Fix is collected through the Mobile Network.

After verifying, these settings please save and apply them.
To test your GPS reception and GPS Fix as position data run a test by MENU "Refresh GPS"
Between 1-10 minutes, you should receive your position on the display in section "GPS Location" of the settings page.
If you successfully received a GPS Fix, the Application Nogago should be able to work with your device.**Wie verhindere ich, dass mein Telefon w√§hrend der Fahrt verrutscht ?**
