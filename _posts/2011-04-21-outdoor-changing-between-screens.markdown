**Changing between screens:**

The different screens available in nogago Outdoor depend on few conditions. Whether you have a GPS fix and ongoing GPS reception and whether you are currently loading or recording a track. Even so, the use of offline maps will only be working when purchased maps are installed on your device's SD-Card. By pressing key-shortcut "**space**" or calling this from system-menu you change between the different screens. In MapScreen, you can additionally change between offline and online map mode by pressing key-shortcut "**Z**" or "**Y**" and by calling the system-menu. On touch-screen devices you may additionally use the trackball-button to call a screen and action selection popup. To call and change to other applications, but leave nogago Outdoor active as background process press and hold blackberry-button until the active application selection appears. To close the application select the system-menu "**close**" or use the key-shortcut "**X**".
