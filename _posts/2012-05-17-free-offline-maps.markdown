You can now download free offline maps using the [nogago Mobile Atlas Creator](http://www.assembla.com/spaces/nogago-open-source/wiki), an open source tool that we have made available for download at

[http://www.assembla.com/spaces/nogago-open-source/wiki](http://www.assembla.com/spaces/nogago-open-source/wiki)

The tool allows you to download maps from various web map providers. You can also add own custom map sources to download from other sources than the once packaged with the tool.
