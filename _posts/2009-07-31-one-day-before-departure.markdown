Tomorrow is the first day of our long distance hike with nogago on BlackBerry and its competitor GARMIN OREGON 550. To prepare for our trip we have done quite some work to prepare the contestants upon which we want to report today.

**Step 1: Getting the hike description as tracks**
Fortunately, there are many tracks available online today. My favorite site is [GPSies.com](http://www.gpsies.com), but for well known long distance hikes in Germany, I actually prefer another site [Wanderkompass](http://www.wanderkompass.de/fernwanderweg/baden-wurttemberg/westweg.html), which has very nice descriptions and pictures of all major trails.

The Westweg, on which we will embark, is recommended to be walked on 12 days, unfortunately too much time for me. So I have decided to skip the first day (which is anyways north of my home town) and walk up from my house to the nearest point of the Westweg (nogago does this ("press 5"!), we will see tomorrow whether the Garmin can do the same).

Also, there are two possibilities (east and west) for the southernmost part of the Westweg. One can actually see almost all of the southern blackforest by walking the western route from "Kalte Herberge" to Basel and then back up to "Kalte Herberge" the other route, where one then can relax a couple of days enjoying the panorama south to the alps...  But I don't have so much time, so I will take the western route.

So, I download the following tracks for etappes [2](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west02/gps_west02.zip), [3](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west03/gps_west03.zip), [4](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west04/gps_west04.zip), [5](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west05/gps_west05.zip), [6](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west06/gps_west06.zip), [7](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west07/gps_west07.zip), [8](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west08/gps_west08.zip), and the western route [9](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west09west/gps_west09w.zip), [10](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west10west/gps_west10w.zip), [11](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west11west/gps_west11w.zip), [12](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west12west/gps_west12w.zip) . Unzip the files and upload the GPX files to the BlackBerry using the desktop connectiong software or alternatively by inserting copying the data on the smartcard that you use with the BlackBerry using your favorite desktop PC operating system.

For GARMIN I had to first install  the desktop client. I downloaded [GARMIN BaseCamp](http://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=4435) from the web, as I am unhappy about vendors shipping stale DVDs even with brand new devices, and indeed the software on the Web was newer than what was on disk (version 2.0.6 as of July 15, 2009). After installation, I had import the GPX tracks (using ctrl-I), which appeared then appeared in the library and where nicely displayed on the map. I liked this very much ! See for yourself, to get an impression where I will be during the next week !

Obviously you could achieve the same with Google earth (one view only) and have aerial photography as well as topographic information so you can actually see the hills and see that I am crawling over every major hilltop. But for an uploading tool, this is nice ! I have attached the GARMIN device using an USB cable, which appeared on the top left corner and just had to track and drop the files.

**Step 2: Getting Maps onto the GARMIN **

In the previous post, I have explained that we ordered Germany Topo v3 as the 1:25000 topographic map from ebay for 60€ because the 180€ street price was just inacceptable for us (we just spent 550€ on the Oregon 550...). Unfortunately the map did not arrive.

Now, there is a free option for those power users on the world, that are daring enough to go back in computer time for about 10 years, fiddle around with files and BATCH files. Go on, and follow our steps, to get the free hiking and biking maps for your GARMIN device. This is made possible by the incredible volunteer street-mapping community behind [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), and - yes - you can contribute too, with every single trace you record, and make the world a better place, atleast mapwise ! Take yourself a good 3 hours, if you have a Windows PC, and want to get it running (if you have gained experience in computer use back in the eighties) :



	
  * [first grab the data](http://openmtbmap.x-nation.de/maps/germany/mtbbaden-wuerttemberg.7z.zip)(in our case MTB Baden Württemberg)

	
  * then unzip using [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/), which you have to install, if you don't have this open source file archiver for windows.

	
  * [Install Mapsource](http://openmtbmap.org/tutorials/install-mapsource/), you need version 6.13.6 (Win Vista/7) or 6..13.6 (Win XP)

	
  * [Install the Openmtbmap in Mapsource](http://openmtbmap.org/tutorials/install/)

	
  * [Install maps with gmaptool](http://openmtbmap.org/tutorials/install/gmaptool-install-maps/) ´

	
  * [Install maps with Mapsettoolkit: ]( http://openmtbmap.org/tutorials/install/installation-with-mapsettoolkit/)

	
  * [Send Maps to GPS with Mapsource: ](http://openmtbmap.org/tutorials/send-maps-to-your-gps/mapsource/)


Once, you are through enjoy the maps on your GARMIN device. You can set the various map parameters in the settings to make the whole thing even a bit nicer.

**Step 3: Getting Maps on the BlackBerry**

We will be offline in the woods, so BlackBerry Maps or Google Maps are no use. Downloading the map over the air will also drain the battery very fast. nogago does not yet have built-in maps, so we will have to install the [Mobile GMaps](http://www.mgmaps.com/). You can do this directly from your Blackberry browser. Just open the built-in browser, choose the "Go To..." command and enter: [http://wap.mgmaps.com/mgmaps_bb.jad](http://wap.mgmaps.com/mgmaps_bb.jad). Follow the installation instructions and of you go.

Now you are able to display offline raster maps (not vector data maps like the GARMIN, the Magellan can display such maps also by the way). Now the only thing missing is the data.

Now, this is a no fun, lengthy procedure and requires a bit of expertise in the workings of the raster maps of this world. If you are on Windows, use [GMapMaker graphical tool](http://www.mgmaps.com/cache/gMapMaker-setup.exe), all others have to go with a [PERL script](http://www.mgmaps.com/cache/MapTileCacher.perl). If you don't know what PERL is, don't even try...

Now, windows users have the joy of a nice graphical display that captures all the options that need to be set.
You need to setup:



	
  * Cache Folder is the folder, where data will be stored

	
  * Parallel downloads of map elements (be nice to the server admins and dont set it too high)

	
  * Operating mode, I chose MGMaps mode, and entered the area where Schwarzwald is located.

	
  * Zoom Level is the level of detail you want to be able to see. Zoom level 15 corresponds roughly to 1:25000 of a topographical map, depending on your display (the BlackBerry display has a higher resolution than computer screens for example).

	
  * Map Type, choosing options other than OpenCycleMap (my favorite), OpenStreetMap or Osmarenderer is illegal (and no use for hiking anyways)!
You can download the maps of Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft using gMapMaker but they will find out and block you.


The whole download procedure for all of Schwarzwald in OpenCycleMap zoom levels 1-16 leads to a download of whopping 1,35 GB. To download the data on to your computer takes about 2 days (hope for no automatic unavoidable Windows bug fix installations that interrupt the download).

Due to a bug in Mobile GMaps you will have to rename the folders in your _MGMapsCache_ folder and replace _Cycle_ by _Street_ in all folder names within the _MGMapsCache_ folder. Do the same in the cache.conf file. Then copy the _MGMapsCache_ folder onto a SDCard and place this SDCard into your BlackBerry. Alternatively you can hook up the BlackBerry using a USB cable and transfer the folder directly on the SDCard inserted into the BlackBerry. The latter aproach is slower and took about 1 hour in my particular case.

You then need to configure the GMaps tool that you have downloaded onto your BlackBerry to use data from the MGMapsCache folder that you have copied onto your SDcard:



	
  * Open the MGMaps application, which ended up in the Download folder after installation

	
  * Press the Application Button on your keyboard (the one with the 7 dots on it) and select _Menu_

	
  * Then select _7. Settings_

	
  * Then check _Stored Maps_

	
  * Then check _Offline Maps_

	
  * Make sure that the storage path is right. If you copied the downloaded data on your SDcard into the folder MGMapsCache, the storage path should read _SDCard/MGMApsCache_. If you put it else where Select _Browse..._ after pressing the application button and select the directory where you have stored the maps.

	
  * Select _Save_ after pressing the application button.

	
  * Close and restart MGMaps for the changes to take place

	
  * You can test the availability of the maps, if you are within the region downloaded and select _Menu/6. GPS/Where am I?_


Learn a bit about GMaps Mobile to successfully use it! for example, spend some time with the [Keyboard shortcuts](http://www.mgmaps.com/help.php). They are not BlackBerry QWERTY-type (you need to press ALT to select numbers and operate most of GMaps). If you would like to be able to see your tracks on top of the card as well, you will have to transfer the KML files in addition to GPX files to your Blackberry. In our case, this means to transfer the KML files contained in the Westweg etappes: [2](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west02/gps_west02.zip), [3](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west03/gps_west03.zip), [4](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west04/gps_west04.zip), [5](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west05/gps_west05.zip), [6](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west06/gps_west06.zip), [7](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west07/gps_west07.zip), [8](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west08/gps_west08.zip), and the western route [9](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west09west/gps_west09w.zip), [10](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west10west/gps_west10w.zip), [11](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west11west/gps_west11w.zip), [12](http://www.wanderkompass.de/images/stories/deutschland/fernwanderwege/westweg/west12west/gps_west12w.zip) .

**Conclusion for the day**

I think, even with the overly complex setup of free mapping data, GARMIN is the clear winner of the day, because the BlackBerry did not make it within a day. With respect to the amount of data needed to be transferred vector beats raster (but this was a no brainer).

Tomorrow is the first day of our long distance hike with nogago on BlackBerry and its competitor GARMIN OREGON 550. To prepare for our trip we have done quite some work to prepare the contestants upon which we want to report today.
