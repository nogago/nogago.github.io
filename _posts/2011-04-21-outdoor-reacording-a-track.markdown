**Recording a track:**

Once the application has received a GPS location fix the "record a track" icon will be selectable and you can start to record your track. A file dialog will ask you the kind of track you wish to record and additional comments for this record. The selection of tracking type determines the frequency of recording a GPX fix point into the recording file. The higher the frequency the better the tracking result resolution but also the higher the cpu and battery consumption on your device. The recorded tracks will be saved into the folder on your SD-Card file://SD-Card/Tracks/Recorded/... as GPX 1.1 File, which is compatible to exchange with many other GPS applications and tools. The recorded tracks will be recorded as tracks with track-segments each time you pause your recording session. At the end of each track recording you will be provided with a short statistic about your track stating total distance, altitude changes etc. While recording a track you can change into the Trip-Computer Display (key-shortcut "space") and review your current movement by changes altitude and speed. The view can be actualized by pressing key-shortcut "**Y**" or by calling the correspondent system-menu-item. To pause recording of a track simply press key-shortcut "**P**" or call system-menu "**Pause Recording**". To display the current recorded path on the MapScreen you can activate the path by pressing "**M**" or via system-menu. Recorded tracks can be loaded from the folder SD-Card file://SD-Card/Tracks/Recorded... at any time and be reviewed on the MapScreen and used to navigate along this track.
